# Automated-Lawn-Mower-Bot-
An Automated Lawn Mower Bot built using IOT


The robot is built on Arduino with the theory focused on IOT. The robot is feeded with pre-built algorithms that determine the size of the field, the nature of the grass and the estimated time. The processor then figures out the shortest path and time required to mow the area. Passes it to the arduino which then commands the motors of the robot allowing it cut the grass automatically.
